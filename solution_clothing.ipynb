    "One of the reasons feature selection is done, automatically or otherwise, is that there might be strong correlations between features. Also recall polynomial regression: a large number of features can lead to overfitting. Feature selection helps curb the problem of the curse of dimensionality, where centrality measures often used in statistics go wonky at higher dimensions. Between feature-engineering which we did some of, earlier, and feature selection, is where a lot of smarts and domain knowledge comes in. You will gain this with experience."
